(10%)

*Question 2:* Please design and implement the solution to crawl all the text-based information of each
publication from the website, to convert such information into a suitable data format, and to
store it in a data file. Explain your design and highlight any features with no more than 250
words. (20%)

*Question 3:* Please design and implement a solution to find out the 100 most popular words used for the title
and the abstract of the publications. You should define what a “word” means under your design.
For example, such “words” can be of an arbitrary length (single word/double word) and/or they
should be as meaningful as possible. Explain your design and highlight any features with no more
than 250 words. (20%)

*Question 4:* Please design and implement the solution to use data analysis and visualization for analysing
which authors collaborate (or appear) as co-authors in the publications. Explain your design,
highlight any features, and showcase your findings with no more than 300 words. (20%)

*Question 5:* Please design and implement the solution to use data analysis and visualization for analysing
how the features of a publication would affect its “citation” (a value that can be found in the
publication detail pages). Explain your design, highlight any features, and showcase your findings
with no more than 400 words. (30%)
